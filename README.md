### How to use it
The widget has only two properties to be set inside the constructor:

 - `List<Widget> Pages`:  A list of widgets to be used as pages.
 - `List<Color> Colors`: A list of colors, ordered to be used with the respective pages.

The only requirement is that both lists have the same number of objects.
Enjoy!
